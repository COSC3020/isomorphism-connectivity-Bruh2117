# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic they do *not* have to
be completely connected. I have started with the formal definition of
isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

Suppose A has 2 nodes that are connected by an edge, making it an unconnected graph. Now suppose B has 2 nodes that aren't connected either. 

We can have a bijective function that maps each node of A to the nodes of B since they have the same number of nodes and there are no adjacent edges. 

Therefore graphs A and B are isomorphic given the defintion of isomorphism, proving that two graphs don't have to be completely connected to be isomorphic.
